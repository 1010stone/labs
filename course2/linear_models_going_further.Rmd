Linear models can be extended in many directions. Here are some examples of extensions, which you might come across in analyzing data in the life sciences:

## Robust linear models

rlm in MASS, robust package

## Generalized linear models

glm

Proportional hazard models

[GLM and survival analysis in R](http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/glm.html)

biglm

speedglm

## Bayesian linear models

lme4, stan, BUGS

## Penalized linear models

Lasso, ridge, elastic net, glmnet

## Many simultaneous linear models

(Y is not M x 1, but M x N)

limma

## Linear models for classification

linear discriminant analysis (related to support vector machines)

$$ \mathbf{w} \mathbf{x}_i > b $$
