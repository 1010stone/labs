# Data Analysis for the Life Sciences

## NEWS:

September 16, 2015 : We are reogranizing the labs here for the new courses launching this Fall.
We have decided to drop the `course1` style of directory structure, as the number of courses
is still in flux. We are now using a modular structure. See `renaming_map.md` for how courses
were remapped to new names.

Compiled versions of the Rmds can be found here:
